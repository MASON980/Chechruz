A clone of T_t_i_. You have to stack the blocks to make full lines without letter the blocks stack up to the top of the screen. Not necessarily using 4 part blocks. Left/right to strafe block, up/down to rotate, space to speed up/next step.</br>
This was made for education and what not, please don't sue.</br>

ISSUES: </br>
--On some computers it is very laggy (possibly Win10).</br>
--Some of the colouring is hard to make out.</br>
--Some of the shapes are quite awkward.  </br>
--I never played T_t_i_ much so there may be other problems.</br>
--Up and down both rotate clockwise.</br>

TODO: (hopefully / if I feel like it)</br>
--Make it look nicer</br>
--More efficient/faster loading/optimization etc. </br>
